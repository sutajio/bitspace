<p>Hi friend!</p>

<p>We just wanted to let you know that <strong><%= @release.user.login %></strong> has just uploaded "<%= @release.title %>" by <strong><%= @release.artist.name %></strong>.</p>

<% if @release.artwork.file? -%>
<img src="<%= @release.artwork.url(:medium, false) %>" width="240" height="240" alt="Artwork" />
<% end -%>

<p>Check it out at:</p>

<p><%= profile_url(@release.user.login, :trailing_slash => true, :anchor => release_path(@release)).gsub('%2F','/') %></p>

<% if @user.subscribes_to?(@release.user) -%>
<p>The release has also been added to your own library:</p>

<p><%= player_url(:trailing_slash => true) %></p>

<p>You can also download the release as a ZIP archive if you want:</p>

<p><%= download_release_url(@release) %></p>
<% end -%>


<p>Regards,</p>
