Hi friend!

We just wanted to let you know that <%= @release.user.login %> has just uploaded "<%= @release.title %>" by <%= @release.artist.name %>.

Check it out at:

<% if @release.user.collector? -%>
<%= profile_url(@release.user.login, :trailing_slash => true, :anchor => release_path(@release)).gsub('%2F','/') %>
<% else %>
<%= release_profile_url(@release.user.login, @release) %>
<% end %>

<% if @user.subscribes_to?(@release.user) -%>
The release has also been added to your own library:

<%= player_url(:trailing_slash => true) %>

You can also download the release as a ZIP archive if you want:

<%= download_release_url(@release) %>
<% end -%>
