    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <p>Authentication is managed using HTTP authentication (only "Basic" is supported
    right now). Every request must include the Authorization HTTP header. Use the
    same username and password that you use to sign in to the Bitspace Player. Example
    with Curl:</p>
    
    <pre><code>curl -u username:password http://url-to-api-here</code></pre>
    
    <p>If authentication fails the HTTP response will be either 403 Forbidden
      (authentication succeeded, but you're not allowed to access the resource
      anyway) or 401 Unauthorized (authentication details are wrong or missing).</p>
    
    <p>You need to supply an <code>Accept: application/json</code> HTTP header
      for your requests to be interpreted as API requests. If you don't do that
      you will instead get a 302 Redirect to the login page if the authentication
      fails.</p>
    
    <p>You can also use an "API token" for authentication. You can find your
    current token on the "Account" page in the Bitspace Player where you can
    also reset the token if necessary. To use the API token for authenticating
    requests to the API you add it as a query paramater to all API requests,
    like this:</p>
      
    <pre><code>curl http://url-to-api?user_credentials=4LiXF7FiGUppIPubBPey</code></pre>
    
    <p>Note that you need to add the <code>user_credentials</code> paramater to <em>all</em>
      calls to the API that you make. It is <em>not</em> persisted between requests.</p>
    
    <p>Be careful with how you handle your API token as it gives complete access to
      your account without having to specify a username and password. You don't
      want it to end up in the wrong hands. If that happens you can simply reset
      the API token from your account page.</p>
      
    <h2>OAuth</h2>
    <p>OAuth is currently not supported.</p>
