    <h3>Please help me understand! What is Bitspace?</h3>
    <p>Bitspace is a convenient and inexpensive way to store and listen to
       your music collection.</p>
       
    <h3>Tell me more...</h3>
    <p>You know that harddrive you have in your closet &ndash; filled with
       music you never listen to &ndash; simply because you can't be bothered
       to to take it out and look through it? Finding and experiencing music
       should be instant.</p>
    <p>Starting to get frustrated with an overloaded iTunes library or an
       empty Spotify playlist staring back at you? Yeah, we too. That's why
       we created Bitspace. We believe that music should be easy, beautiful
       and always available.</p>
    <p>That feeling of looking through a box of vinyls in a record shop, that
       special smell and the huge artwork. Or the feeling of downloading that
       obscure bootleg you have been looking for for months. That's what we
       are aiming at recreating.</p>
    
    <h3>Does it Scrobble&trade;?</h3>
    <p>Yes, we will be fully integrated with <a href="http://last.fm/" class="external">Last.fm</a>
       as soon as the private beta is over.</p>
    
    <h3>Can I share my music with my friends?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can share your music using many integrated sharing services
       (a feature that will be launched sometime in the coming weeks).
       We are for example working on an integration with the <a
       href="http://developer.spotify.com/en/metadata-api/overview/" class="external">Spotify API</a>.</p>

    <h3>How can I get Bitspace?</h3>
    <p>Either you get invited and can start out with a free account, or you
       <%= link_to('sign up', price_path) %> for a <strong>Premium</strong> or
       <strong>Unlimited</strong> account. Both are free for the first 30 days
       and you are of course free to end your subscription at any time.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I use Bitspace?</h3>
    <p>You login and upload your music. Then you listen to it. It's that simple.</h3>
    
    <h3>Do I have to listen to or look at ads?</h3>
    <p>No, we will never ever show banners or make you listen to ads between
       tracks on Bitspace. Not even on the free plan.</p>
    
    <h3>Why should I use Bitspace instead of iTunes or Spotify, for example?</h3>
    <p>iTunes store is a great way to buy music and the iTunes music player is
    a great music player and a great way to organize your music collection.
    But what happens when your harddrive crashes, or when you want to listen
    to your own music at your friends place, at work or while traveling?
    Bitspace solves all of that.</p>
    <p>Spotify is a great service for sharing music. It allows you to easily
    send a link to your friends that they can listen to for free. But
    Spotify is not a great way to organize your music collection. A label
    or artist can suddenly decide to withdraw all its music, and a lot of
    music is not available on Spotify at all to begin with. Bitspace on the
    other hand does not limit your taste in music.</p>

  <div class="grid_4">
    <h3>Can I use Bitspace just like I use iTunes or Spotify?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Right now the only thing you need is a Webkit based browser like
       <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/" class="external">Apple Safari</a>
       and <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" class="external">Google Chrome</a>
       (or <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe" class="external">Google Chrome Frame</a>
       in IE). The listening experience is exactly the same.</p>
    
    <h3>Do I have to use Bitspace in my browser?</h3>
    <p>We are considering releasing a desktop client, but haven't made up our minds yet.
       Meanwhile, if you want a more desktop like experience, we recommend
       that you try out <a href="http://fluidapp.com/" class="external">
       Fluid</a> (on OS X).</p>
    
    <h3>Why not Firefox?</h3>
    <p>Firefox does not support playing MP3 files using the HTML5 audio-tag,
       only Ogg Vorbis files. We are working on a fix.</p>
    
    <h3>Is there an iPhone app?</h3>
    <p>We're working on it. We believe we have some great ideas about how the
       mobile music experience can be improved overal and some new and
       innovative features that we hope you will enjoy using. It's going to be
       awesome. That's all we can say.</p>
    
    <h3>Is my precious music safe on Bitspace?</h3>
    <p>We take very good care of your music here at Bitspace. We're like the
       nice friend that you pay to feed your Tamagotchi while you'r away doing
       important stuff.</p>
    <p>All files are stored at least three times in at least two different
       geographically separated datacenters. So if one is crushed by Godzilla,
       the other one should still be up and running.</p>
    <p>We have very rigorous security and data backup processes. We won't lose
       a bit. Promise!</p>
    
    <h3>Can I really use Bitspace from anywhere?</h3>
    <p>Yep! Bitspace is available worldwide. It's the same experience no
      matter where you might live at the moment. We use a professional
      Content Delivery Network (CDN) with edge locations in the US, EU and
      Asia to stream the music to you. That means your songs load just as fast
      from Tokyo or Hong Kong as from Stockholm or New York.</p>
    
    <h3>How does the 30-day free trial work?</h3>
    <p>If you cancel a paying plan within 30 days of signing up you won’t be
    charged a thing. If you do choose to cancel your account in the future you
    will never be charged again, but you are responsible for charges already
    incurred up until your cancellation. Refunds can not be issued after your
    initial 30 day trial and we don’t prorate for partial months.</p>

    <h3>Do I get a 30-day free trial if I upgrade?</h3>
    <p>If you upgrade from a free account to a pay account you are not
    eligible for the 30-day free trial. The 30-day free trial on paying plans
    only applies if you sign up for a paying plan now.</p>
